<p>0-Cribbage does not resemble Cribbage at all (as you might expect), although it is cute.</p>
<p>The throwing and pegging phases of each hand now finish instantly, leaving only the turn-up and counting phases.</p>
<p>This means there are only two ways to earn points in 0-Cribbage:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A one-card flush (1 point)</li>
    <li>His heels (2 points) for cutting up a Jack</li>
</ul>
<p>This means the dealer will automatically receive 2 points per hand, while a non-dealer will get 1. In addition to that, the dealer has a 13 in 52 chance of getting two more points, for a weighted average of 2.154 points per hand for the dealer. This gives whoever wins the deal a sizeable advantage.</p>
<p>Essentially, 0-Cribbage boils down to a drawn-out coin flip with a small chance of an upset, assuming there is no strategy involved in cutting the deck (which there isn’t unless cheating is involved).</p>
<p>If there is any demand I will do a statistical analysis to figure out how likely an upset is. But it’s pretty unlikely.</p>
